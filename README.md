Facebook Hacker Cup Solutions
-----------------------------

This is simply a little repository for storing my soultions for Hackercup! I may periodically look back at this to remember how I approached something algorithmically but mostly this is just for fun!

All of the source files you'll find here are written in [Go](http://golang.org).

Feel free to fork this and use it as however you choose! Also **follow me** *(if you feel so inclined)*.

Cheers!
